Final project for Mobile App Development 1.

## CineLooks
CineLooks is an iOS multiview application built using the MVC design pattern. The main screen displays a list of cinematic color "looks" using a UITableView, and selecting any item navigates to a detailed view showing the look's name, category, and description. The detail view dynamically updates its background and text colors based on the selected look to create a cohesive visual palette All data is modeled using a ColorLook struct and sourced from ColorLookData. The UI layout is created with Auto Layout and safe-area constraints, ensuring full compatibility across all device sizes, including iPads and landscape orientation.
